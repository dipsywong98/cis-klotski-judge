# Klotski

[Klotski(華容道)]((https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klotski)) is an interesting game, why not making it.

## Our set up

There are 10 blocks of different variations:

- 1 2x2
- 4 1x2
- 1 2x1
- 4 1x1

The blocks are placed inside a 5x4 box, they can only slide vertically or horizontally, without overlapping other blocks, and within the area inside the box.

Each board configuration is defined using a string of 20 characters, where each unique letter represent a piece of block, each four characters in the string represent a row in the board, and @ character represent an empty space.

For example, `BAACBAACDEEFDGHFI@@J` can be interpreted as

```
BAAC
BAAC
DEEF
DGHF
I@@J
```

and render as

Using a series of block letters and compass notations can denote the movement of blocks.

For example

```
GSJWFSEEDEINGW
```

Denotes move block G to south, then block J to west, then block F to south, then block E to east, then block D to east, etc...

## Your task

Given an initial board configuration, a series of moves, return the result board configuration string

You need to expose a `POST` endpoint `/klotski` that accepts json of the following shape

```json
[
  {
    "board": "BCDEBCFGAAFGAAHHI@@J",
    "moves": "IEIEASBSCSDWDWEWEWFNGNHNINIEAE"
  },
  {
    "board": "BBAACCAADDE@FGG@HIJJ",
    "moves": "EEDEFNGEHNINJWJWGSESIEHEFSDWASBEBECNDNFNHNJNGWGWESISASDEDEFNHNJNGNIWIWEWEWASJEJEGNENEWAW"
  },
  {
    "board": "BAACDAAE@FF@GHIJGHIJ",
    "moves": "DSBSFEDEBSAWEWENFNDEDEBEBEASEWEWCWCWFNDNDWJNJNIEBSBSDSDSAEGNGNHWDWDSASCSCEEEESFWGNHNDWJNINBEAS"
  }
]

```

and respond a json of corresponding resultant board

```json
[
  "DEFGBCFGBCHH@AAI@AAJ",
  "CCBBFHDDGGJJEAA@IAA@",
  "GFFJGECJH@@IHAAIDAAB",
]
```
