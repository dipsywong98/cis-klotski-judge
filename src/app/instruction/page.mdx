# Klotski

[Klotski(華容道)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klotski) is an interesting game, why not making it.

## Our set up

The blocks are placed inside a 5x4 box, they can only slide vertically or horizontally, without overlapping other blocks, and within the area inside the box.

Each board configuration is defined using a string of 20 characters, where each unique letter represent a piece of block, each four characters in the string represent a row in the board, and @ character represent an empty space.

For example, board string `BCCDBEEDFAAGFAAG@HI@` can be interpreted as

```
BCCD
BEED
FAAG
FAAG
@HI@
```

and render as

The move notation is a string of even number length, where we can split it by every two characters - first character is the block name, second character is how we slide the block, using compass notation (NSWE).

For example the moves string `HWIEAS` can be splited to `HW` `IE` `AS`, that is to move block H to west, then block I to east, then block A to south.

## Your task

Given an initial board string, a moves string, return the result board string.

You need to expose a `POST` endpoint `/klotski` that accepts a `application/json` payload of the following shape

```json
[
  {
    "board": "BCDEBCFGAAFGAAHHI@@J",
    "moves": "IEIEASBSCSDWDWEWEWFNGNHNINIEAE"
  },
  {
    "board": "BBAACCAADDE@FGG@HIJJ",
    "moves": "EEDEFNGEHNINJWJWGSESIEHEFSDWASBEBECNDNFNHNJNGWGWESISASDEDEFNHNJNGNIWIWEWEWASJEJEGNENEWAW"
  },
  {
    "board": "BAACDAAE@FF@GHIJGHIJ",
    "moves": "DSBSFEDEBSAWEWENFNDEDEBEBEASEWEWCWCWFNDNDWJNJNIEBSBSDSDSAEGNGNHWDWDSASCSCEEEESFWGNHNDWJNINBEAS"
  }
]

```

and respond a json of corresponding resultant board

```json
[
  "DEFGBCFGBCHH@AAI@AAJ",
  "CCBBFHDDGGJJEAA@IAA@",
  "GFFJGECJH@@IHAAIDAAB",
]
```

In actual test case the array will be longer, so as the moves string.
